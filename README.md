# SystemsAnalysis-KKBOX_Challenge

## System Analysis Report
We, as a group analyzing, solving, and interpreting __KKBOX's__ main problem, primarily after reading the project _requirements_, noted the main aspects in which __users__, __songs__, their __context__, and __time__ could help us generate an efficient _system_ for predicting musical tastes for future listeners.

We took the main concepts of _systemic analysis_, compared them, and defined each aspect in our report, such as __listening events__, the __relationships__ between __users__ and __songs__, the _complexity_ and _sensitivity_ of the system, information available in the _data sets_, and _system boundaries_, etc... Based on all of the above, we linked terms and were able to determine our strategy for the Kaggle competition, focusing on our _strengths_ and trying to improve our _weaknesses_.

This is the main Overleaf document, which we used to make the report about the Kaggle competition. https://www.overleaf.com/project/67f5f01d92c80a0d831bfc5e 

## System Design
Throughout the workshop, we analyzed and developed the architecture of the __KKBOX Music Recommendation System__, guided by the principles of __systemic analysis__. Using the provided datasets, we explored how __users__, __songs__, __listening events__, and __contextual variables__ such as time and source type interact within the system. Our focus was to design an architecture capable of managing _noise_, _missing data_, and _chaotic user behavior_ while maintaining high predictive performance.

The architectural diagrams _Global System and Data Ingestion_ illustrate the modular structure and the interaction between layers such as __Data Management__, __Feature Processing__, __Model Core__, and __Monitoring & Control__. Each layer plays a critical role in ensuring _stability_, _scalability_, and _adaptability_ under real-world streaming conditions.
