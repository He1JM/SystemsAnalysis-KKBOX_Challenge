# SystemsAnalysis-KKBOX_Challenge
We, as a group analyzing, solving, and interpreting __KKBOX's__ main problem, primarily after reading the project _requirements_, noted the main aspects in which __users__, __songs__, their __context__, and __time__ could help us generate an efficient _system_ for predicting musical tastes for future listeners.

We took the main concepts of _systemic analysis_, compared them, and defined each aspect in our report, such as __listening events__, the __relationships__ between __users__ and __songs__, the _complexity_ and _sensitivity_ of the system, information available in the _data sets_, and _system boundaries_, etc... Based on all of the above, we linked terms and were able to determine our strategy for the Kaggle competition, focusing on our _strengths_ and trying to improve our _weaknesses_.
